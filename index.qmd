I am a postdoctoral researcher at Sandia National Laboratories working on accelerating modeling and simulation by leveraging scientific machine learning tools.
Specifically, I have been working to speed up calibrations of expensive models of epidemics to match real world observations.

Previously, I was a PhD student of Applied Mathematics at the New Jersey Institute of Technology researching data-driven model discovery for active nematic fluid systems.

I'm generally interested in a wide range of machine learning and data science applications and have experience with a range of different physical systems.

<!-- I am also fascinated by the topics of public infrastructure and agriculture, although they are quite unrelated to my current work. -->
<!-- Honestly, I'm interested in most topics once I get chatting, so please reach out! -->
