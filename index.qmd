I am a PhD student of Applied Mathematics at the New Jersey Institute of Technology.
My current research is focused on data-driven model discovery for active nematic fluid systems.
But I'm generally interested in the intersections between machine learning and data science with traditional approaches in computational science.

<!-- I am also fascinated by the topics of public infrastructure and agriculture, although they are quite unrelated to my current work. -->
<!-- Honestly, I'm interested in most topics once I get chatting, so please reach out! -->

On this site you can find my [CV](cv.qmd), my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/connor-robertson-773ba8b1/) and [Github](https://github.com/cnrrobertson) profiles, and some other little tidbits for [teaching](teaching/teaching.html), [research](research/research.html), [seminars](other/machinelearning_optimization_seminar/machinelearning_optimization_seminar.qmd), and [general exploration](other/fun/fun.qmd).
