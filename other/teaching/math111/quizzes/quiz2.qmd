## Problem 1
### Question
Show that the graph of $f(x) = 3x^2 + 5x - 11 = 0$ has a solution between $x=1$ and $x=2$.
State which theorem you used.

### Solution
Since we know that $f(x)$ is a polynomial and thus continous, we can use the [intermediate value theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermediate_value_theorem) to show that there exists a root between the points.
To do so we need to show that the function is above the x-axis at one of the endpoints and below at the other:
$$
\begin{align*}
f(1) &= 3(1)^2 + 5(1) - 11 = 3 + 5 - 11 = -3 < 0 \\
f(2) &= 3(2)^2 + 5(2) - 11 = 12 + 10 - 11 = 11 > 0
\end{align*}
$$


## Problem 2
### Question
Find constants $a,b$ so that the function given below is continuous for all $x$:
$$
f(x) = \begin{cases}
x^2 + 3 & x<2 \\
a & x = 2 \\
ax+b & x > 2
\end{cases}
$$

### Solution
First, we need to make sure that the left most part of the function connects with the center part:
$$
\begin{align*}
a &= x^2 + 3 \text{ at }x=2 \\
&= (2)^2 + 3 \\
\Aboxed{a &= 7}
\end{align*}
$$
Next, we match the center part to the rightmost part:
$$
\begin{align*}
a &= ax + b\text{ at }x=2 \\
7 &= 7(2) + b \\
b &= 7 - 14 \\
\Aboxed{b &= -7}
\end{align*}
$$
