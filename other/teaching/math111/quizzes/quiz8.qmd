## Problem 1
### Question
Given the function $y = 3x^4 - 4x^3$,

#### a)
Where is it increasing or decreasing?

#### b)
Where is it concave up or down?

#### c)
What are the local minima and maxima?

#### d)
Sketch the graph

### Solution

#### a)
To find where it is increasing or decreasing, we can look at the sign of the derivative (the sign of the slope):
$$
\begin{align}
y &= 3x^4 - 4x^3 \\
y' &= 12x^3 - 12x^2 \\
&= 12x^2(x - 1)
\end{align}
$$
This has critical points at $x=0,1$.
Since $x^2$ is always positive, we can find our intervals by considering the sign of $(x-1)$ in the regions $(-\infty,0),(0,1),(1,\infty)$.
Our intervals are then:

- Increasing: $(1,\infty)$
- Decreasing: $(-\infty,0),(0,1)$

#### b)
To find where it is concave up or down, we can look at the sign of the second derivative:
$$
\begin{align}
y' &= 12x^3 - 12x^2 \\
y'' &= 36x^2 - 24x \\
&= 12x(3x - 2)
\end{align}
$$
This has inflection points at $x=0,2/3$.
Our intervals are then:

- Concave down: $(0,2/3)$
- Concave up: $(-\infty,0),(2/3,\infty)$

#### c)
Given the results in part a, we know that:

- Local minima: $x=1$
- Local maxima: None

#### d)

## Problem 2
### Question
Given the function $y = 2 + 3x^2 - x^3$,

#### a)
Where is it increasing or decreasing?

#### b)
Where is it concave up or down?

#### c)
What are the local minima and maxima?

#### d)
Sketch the graph

### Solution

#### a)
To find where it is increasing or decreasing, we can look at the sign of the derivative (the sign of the slope):
$$
\begin{align}
y &= 2 + 3x^2 - x^3\\
y' &= 6x - 3x^2\\
&= 3x(2 - x)\\
\end{align}
$$
This has critical points at $x=0,2$.
Our intervals are then:

- Increasing: $(0,2)$
- Decreasing: $(-\infty,0),(2,\infty)$

#### b)
To find where it is concave up or down, we can look at the sign of the second derivative:
$$
\begin{align}
y' &= 6x - 3x^2\\
y'' &= 6 - 6x \\
&= 6(1 - x)
\end{align}
$$
This has an inflection point at $x=1$.
Our intervals are then:

- Concave down: $(1,\infty)$
- Concave up: $(-\infty,1)$

#### c)
Given the results in part a, we know that:

- Local minima: $x=0$
- Local maxima: $x=2$

#### d)
