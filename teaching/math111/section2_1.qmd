title: Section 2.1 - Limits and Continuity
---

**Motivation:** People were interested in the speed and direction of planets at any moment in time.
So, they wanted to know if they could calculate that by measuring the path of the planets.
We can use a concept called "limits" to find this speed and direction.

## Overview
- Calculus relates the rate of changes of things. i.e. how quickly does water empty out of a barrel is a ratio of the rate of change of the water relative to the rate of change of time.

### Average and Instantaneous Speed
- **Average speed**: Divide the distance traveled by the time elapsed
- **Instantaneous speed**: The average speed over an infinitely small amount of time

### Average Rates of Change and Secant Lines
- **Secant line**: A line connecting two points on a curve
- As the two points of a secant line get closer and closer, the slope of the secant approaches the instantaneous velocity

### Defining the Slope of a Curve
- **Tangent line**: A line that only touches one point on a line
- The slope of a curve at a point $x$ is the slope of the tangent line that passes through only $x$

### Instantaneous Rates of Change and Tangent Lines
- For a curve that represents a quantity (y-axis) over time (x-axis), the slope of the tangent line at a point $t$ in time is the instantaneous velocity (or rate of change of time) at $t$
- Formula for secant line / average velocity from time $t_1$ to $t_2$ where function $f(t)$ is the position at time $t$ and $\Delta$ represents "change in ...":
$$
\boxed{\frac{\Delta f}{\Delta t}} = \frac{f(t_2) - f(t_1)}{t_2 - t_1} = \frac{f(t+h) - f(t)}{t+h - t} = \boxed{\frac{f(t+h) - f(t)}{h}}
$$
